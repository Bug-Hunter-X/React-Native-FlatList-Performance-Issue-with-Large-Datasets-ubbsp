# React Native FlatList Performance Issue with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native with large datasets. The app may become unresponsive or crash when rendering a substantial amount of data.  The problem is particularly noticeable on certain devices or under specific conditions.

## Problem Description

The provided `DataList.js` file contains a basic implementation of FlatList that fetches data from a remote API.  With large datasets, this leads to performance degradation.

## Solution

The solution, found in `DataListSolution.js`, addresses the issue using techniques such as pagination, virtualization (windowing), and optimized data structures.  The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific nature and size of the dataset and application requirements.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run the app on a device or emulator
4. Observe the performance when fetching and rendering a large dataset.  The original version will likely exhibit performance problems, while the solution provides a smoother experience.

## Key improvements in the solution

- Improved data loading and rendering performance.
- Better memory management for enhanced responsiveness and stability.
